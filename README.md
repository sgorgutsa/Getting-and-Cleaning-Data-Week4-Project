# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week4-Project
This repository contains my submission for the Week 4 peer-graded assignment of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" project. The main purpose of the R script is to transform the raw data set, which contains bulk data collected from smartphone's accelrometers during variuos physical activities for 30 subjects, into an independent tidy data set. Tidy data set contains only the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

A code book (CodeBook.md) describes the variables, the data, and all transformations performed to clean up the data.
